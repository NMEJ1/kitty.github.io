<h1><b>Are Cats Jerks?</b></h1>
<p>Yes and no. Cats have strange tendancies and instincts that come from  years of evolution that make them act the way they do today. so is the cat that scratched you when you tried to pet it a jerk? Yes, but only because it's instincts told it to do it.</p> <br>
<img class= "profilepic" src="images\kittyimage2.webp">
<ul> 
<lh> How are cats jerks? </lh>
<Li>they attack your feet when you walk by</Li>
	<Li> they show you their belly only to scratch you when you try to give them belly rubs </Li>
		<Li> they bit you when you try to play with them </Li>
		<Li>they intentionaly sleep on the sunniest step on the stiars where half the time poeple don't see them and end up either stepping on them by accident or tripping on them and falling down the stairs.</Li>
</ul>

<section ID="attackers" class= "attackers box">
<h1>Why do Cats attack your feet when you walk past them?</h1>
<p>They do it when you wear socks mostly. The reason for this is that when you wear socks they don't recognize your feet and think they are gigantic mice. Why they think they would win in a fight with 2 gigantic mice I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that Cats are incredibly vain, but that's only a guess. the more likely explanation is it triggers their hunting instinct and they attack before they can fully think through what they're doing. then again maybe they know what they're doing and they can probably win against the mice, seing as how one cat can win in a  fight against another cat it's same size or bigger.</p> <br>

<section Id = "funfacts" class= "funfacts box">
<h1><b>Fun Facts</b></h1>
<p>Fun fact numero uno; Cats only meow at their parents and humans. does that mean that they think of humans as their parents or is it because we feed them? all I know is that whatevere the reason, they make a completely different noise when they are hunting.
<br>Fun fact number 2; sometimes when Cats hunt they make strange sounds like what appears to be something choking, only to be perfectly fine in the end.</p>

<section id = "toys" class= "toys box">
<H1> <B> what do cats like to play with?</B> </H1>
<p> Cats are strange creatures and the like to play with a lot of thing ranging from a peice of stinrg all the way to something like your foot when your sleeping. my cats favorite toys are my foot, a ball of stinrg a bunch of toy mouses and other thing liekt hat including  the rifregerator where they usually egt their toy mausses stuck under until I can come to thewir rescue and use a weird stick to get the, out. too much informtaiotn? maybe, btu it's true! the most common places for cats to play are on the sitars, anywhere that is at a major inonvenience to their owners, and any place that is dangerous for them to be, sucj as on the stair railing, on top of the stovve when your boiling water for pasta, or even on fences if it's dangerous enough. </p> 
</section>
<section id="danger" class= "dangercats box">
<h1> <b> wwhat kinds of dnagour places ot cats liek to be and why?</b> </h1>
<P> some expamples of dangerous places cats like to be are (I already said this one) on top of the stove while your cooking. they love to play with death. one time my cat actually almost rolled off the stove intot he pot of water, but thankfully my dad saw him and managed to catch him before he fell in. that was a long time ago and he still does stuff like that now.</P>
</section>
<section id="beloved" class= "beloved box">
<h1><b> how do we stop our beloved pets from doing stupid things?</b></h1>
<p> the answer: it's impossible to stop animals form doing what they wnat to unless your willing to put them through long and hard extensive training in order to stop them form doing it, which will probably be depressing to your pet, so just roll with it and I suggest you start putitng somehting sticky on top of the stove to deter your cat form going there if it likes going up there. if not then you shouldn't worry. your pet will proabbaly find other ways to cause and emergency vet visit, but at least they won't almost die because of stupidity right?</p>
</section>
<section id="vet" class = "vetvisits box">
<H1><b>what to do if your cat needs and emergency vet visit because it did somehting stupid</b></H1>
<p> as a continuation we are ging to be batlking about what we do if your pet does something incredibly stupid, like eating a sock, and needs and emergency vet visit. step one, call al the emergency vet clinics around you before you go there, if they're closed you may not be able to find a good one in time. step 2: make sure that your vet knows that your coming so that they're ready for you when you come. any just some advice, keep your cata way form catnip. it acts like a toxin to them making them act the way we do when we encounter alcahol. yes I dont know how to spell alcahol, but you get the gist of it.</p>
</section>
<section id="play" class = "playful box">
<H1><b>when do you play wiht your cats?</b></H1>
<p> the wnaswer is easy. you can play with your cats at any time you like, ranging form th emdidle of the night when the are most active all the way to the middle of the day when they were less, btu still, pretty active. depending ont he mount of energy a cat has you whould either play with it or than usual of play with it less than uaual. usual being about 2 times for day, maybe less maybe more.

<SECTION id="me" class ="me box">
	<h1> <b> about me</b></h1>
	<p> Hi! My name is Nikky and this is the fourth time Iv'e have to rewrite this. interesting fact, I couldn't figure out where to put this! int he end I sitll may move it agian but for  now this is where it lives. I hate getting scam calls and I also hate it when somehting is not stirght,liuek a paitng, although I support people iin the lgbtq+ community. I ama bit of a perfectionist and if you are reaidng this then that means that I am yet to put a lock on this sections of the webpage.  so for now all your geting to knwo abotume is odd habits. I liek to write and read too, but if you tyr to send me scam messages then I will likely not read them and not respond to them unless it is to tell you I'm not interested in what your selling. if eithe rof these thinsg are ever to heppen and you ever receive anything regarding somehting liek this then it may e a mistake and I may have snet it to thw wrng person or someone hacked me and sent it to someone else. theres a lot of posobilities.
